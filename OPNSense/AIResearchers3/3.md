# Bell Home Hub Router Configuration Options for Multi-Subnet Networking

Bell Home Hub routers present specific challenges when integrating with additional networking equipment like OPNsense. After examining your current setup, I've identified several potential solutions to enable communication between your Bell network (192.168.100.0/24) and lab network (198.18.1.0/24). The inability to ping across subnets and traffic being routed to the internet instead of locally indicates routing configuration issues that can be addressed through specific Bell Home Hub settings.

## Bell Home Hub Routing Capabilities

Bell Home Hub routers, including the 3000 model you're using, have significant limitations in their routing capabilities. According to multiple sources, these devices don't support standard networking features found in more advanced routers:

### Static Routes
Bell Home Hub routers do not support configuring static routes[1][17]. This is a critical limitation for your setup, as static routes would normally be the simplest solution for routing between two local subnets. A Bell support representative explicitly confirmed: "you can't configure a static route on Bell-supplied equipment"[17].

Bell modems are designed with simplicity in mind, where "all Bell modems by default are 192.168.2.0/24 and the only thing that an end user can change is the 3rd octet"[1]. This limited configurability explains why traffic is being sent to the internet instead of staying local - the Bell router has no knowledge of how to reach your 198.18.1.0/24 network.

### IP Subnet Configuration
Your current Bell router configuration using 192.168.100.0/24 is non-standard for Bell equipment. Most Bell Home Hubs use 192.168.2.0/24 by default[4][15]. The IP address range typically assigned by Bell modems is "192.168.2.10 to 192.168.2.254"[15]. This configuration difference might contribute to some of your connectivity issues.

## Available Configuration Options

Since static routes aren't available, you'll need to consider alternative methods to achieve proper routing between networks:

### PPPoE Pass-Through (Recommended Solution)
The most effective and stable solution for your setup is to implement PPPoE pass-through, which essentially allows your OPNsense router to connect directly to Bell's network:

"Connect the HH3K LAN to your router WAN and then configure the WAN to connect with PPPoE; you'll be able to get your b1 from your MyBell account as well as changing the password. This is the only step that you need to do and you'll be fine as this will give your router an external IP and avoid the double NAT issue"[6].

This method bypasses the routing limitations of the Bell Home Hub by making OPNsense your primary router with a public IP address. PPPoE pass-through works for every machine and gives you complete control over routing[3].

### Advanced DMZ
If PPPoE pass-through isn't feasible, the Bell Home Hub offers an "Advanced DMZ" feature that can partially address your needs:

"The advanced DMZ feature allows a device to use the modem's WAN IP address as its own. It also puts the device outside the modem's firewall"[7].

This would let your OPNsense router obtain the Bell router's WAN IP, allowing for more direct communication. However, this method has known stability issues: "After a period of time, or if the HH3000 gets disconnected from your own router, internet access will be lost... when the HH3000 needs to renew the DHCP lease (every 3 days by default), everything goes to hell"[6].

## Implementation Steps

### For PPPoE Pass-Through (Recommended)

1. Obtain your Bell PPPoE credentials:
   - Username will be your "b1" username from your MyBell account
   - Password can be changed through your MyBell account or by contacting Bell support[5]

2. Connect your Bell Home Hub and OPNsense:
   - Connect a LAN port from the Bell Home Hub to the WAN port on OPNsense[6]
   - Make sure you're using the appropriate LAN port on the Bell Hub (some ports may be reserved for TV services)[5]

3. Configure OPNsense WAN interface:
   - Set the WAN interface to use PPPoE protocol
   - Enter your Bell b1 username and password
   - Enable IPv6 if needed (optional)
   - Leave MTU settings at default values[5]

4. Optional: Disable unnecessary services on Bell Home Hub:
   - Disable Wi-Fi if not needed
   - Disable features like UPnP that might interfere
   - Leave any Bell TV services connected directly to the Bell Home Hub[5]

5. Reboot both devices:
   - First reboot the Bell Home Hub
   - After it fully starts, reboot OPNsense

6. Verify OPNsense has received a public IP on its WAN interface

### For Advanced DMZ (Alternative Option)

1. Log into your Bell Home Hub:
   - Enter 192.168.100.254 in a browser (your Bell router IP)
   - Log in with administrator credentials

2. Configure Advanced DMZ:
   - Navigate to "Advanced Tools and Settings" > "DMZ"
   - Select your OPNsense router (by MAC address or IP - 192.168.100.137)
   - Important: Check the "Advanced DMZ" box (this is crucial)[7][12]
   - Save the settings

3. Set static IP or DHCP reservation for OPNsense:
   - Either configure a static IP on OPNsense's WAN interface
   - Or reserve IP 192.168.100.137 for OPNsense in Bell Home Hub DHCP settings[6]

4. Disable port forwarding rules on Bell Home Hub:
   - "Don't forget to disable any port forwarding rules... WAN pass-through will not work with rules enabled"[7]

5. Reboot both devices:
   - First reboot the Bell Home Hub (takes about 3 minutes)
   - Then reboot OPNsense

## Known Limitations and Considerations

Bell Home Hub routers are designed for simple home networks, and Bell's technical choices reflect this: "Bell's hardware is tailored for the average consumer, which I believe represents about 90% of their user base. For anyone requiring more advanced settings, it's necessary to utilize your own equipment"[1].

Your specific issue with traceroute showing traffic going to the internet suggests the Bell router lacks knowledge of the 198.18.1.0/24 network. Since static routes aren't supported, you'll need to rely on one of the alternative methods described above to centralize routing through OPNsense.

If your Bell service includes TV, note that PPPoE pass-through maintains TV functionality: "L'IPTV continue de fonctionner en WI-FI sur la bande dédier, il faut juste s'assurer que le récepteur câblé reste brancher sur la Borne 3000 et non sur votre autre réseau local principale"[8].

With these changes implemented, you should be able to achieve proper routing between your Bell network devices and lab environment by leveraging OPNsense as your primary router.
