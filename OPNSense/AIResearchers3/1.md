## Bell Home Hub Router Configuration Options

The Bell Home Hub routers, such as the Home Hub 3000, have limited configuration options for advanced networking needs. Here's an overview of the options you've inquired about:

### 1. Static Routes
- **Support:** Bell Home Hubs do not support adding static routes. Users are restricted from modifying the routing table directly[1].
- **Alternative:** To achieve routing between different subnets, you would need to use a different router that supports static routing.

### 2. Bridge Mode
- **Support:** Bell Home Hubs do not offer a true bridge mode. Instead, they have an "Advanced DMZ" feature that can be used to forward traffic to a single device, but it's not ideal for multi-router setups[2][3].
- **Alternative:** Use PPPoE Pass-Through if available in your region to bypass the Home Hub's limitations.

### 3. IP Passthrough/DMZ
- **Support:** The Advanced DMZ feature can be used to forward traffic to a single device, but it's not suitable for forwarding all traffic to another router like OPNsense[2][3].
- **Alternative:** PPPoE Pass-Through can be used to obtain a public IP on your own router, effectively bypassing the Home Hub's limitations.

### 4. Advanced Routing Tables or Configuration
- **Support:** The Home Hub does not support advanced routing configurations. It is designed for basic consumer use[1].

### Known Issues and Alternatives

- **Security Features:** The issue you're experiencing might not be directly related to security features but rather the lack of routing capabilities.
- **Multi-Router Setups:** Bell Home Hubs are not designed for complex multi-router setups. They are best used with PPPoE Pass-Through or by using a different router as the primary device.

### Recommended Solution

1. **PPPoE Pass-Through:**
   - If available in your region (e.g., Ontario or Quebec), set the Bell Home Hub to PPPoE Pass-Through mode.
   - Connect your OPNsense router to the Home Hub's LAN port and configure it to obtain an IP via PPPoE.
   - Ensure all devices connect through the OPNsense router for proper routing and security.

2. **Advanced DMZ (Limited Use):**
   - If PPPoE Pass-Through is not available, you can use the Advanced DMZ feature to forward traffic to your OPNsense router.
   - However, this method is limited and may not work well with multi-interface setups.

3. **Replace the Home Hub:**
   - Consider using a more capable router as the primary device. This would require bypassing the Home Hub entirely, which might be challenging without PPPoE Pass-Through.

### Steps for PPPoE Pass-Through

1. **Enable PPPoE Pass-Through on the Home Hub:**
   - Log into the Home Hub's web interface.
   - Look for the PPPoE Pass-Through option and enable it.

2. **Configure OPNsense:**
   - Connect the WAN interface of OPNsense to the Home Hub's LAN port.
   - Configure OPNsense to obtain an IP via PPPoE.
   - Ensure that all devices are connected through OPNsense for proper routing.

3. **Verify Connectivity:**
   - Test connectivity from devices on both networks to ensure they can reach each other.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security:** Ensure that all devices are properly secured behind the OPNsense router.
- **Performance:** Monitor network performance to ensure that the setup does not introduce bottlenecks.

By using PPPoE Pass-Through or replacing the Home Hub with a more capable router, you can achieve the desired routing between your local subnets.
