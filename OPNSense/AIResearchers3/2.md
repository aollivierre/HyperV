Based on analysis of Bell Home Hub capabilities and your network configuration, here's the technical breakdown and recommended solution:

### Key Limitations of Bell Home Hub 3000/4000
1. **No Static Routing Support**  
   Bell routers lack static route configuration options[1][5], making inter-subnet routing between 192.168.100.0/24 and 198.18.1.0/24 impossible through native GUI settings.

2. **Limited Bridge Mode Implementation**  
   The "Advanced DMZ" feature isn't true bridge mode and only works reliably for single-device configurations[2][3]. PPPoE passthrough is more stable for router bypass[5][9].

3. **Double NAT Complications**  
   Current configuration creates two NAT layers (Bell → OPNsense), breaking bidirectional routing between networks.

### Recommended Solution: PPPoE Passthrough
**Implementation Steps**  
1. **Retrieve PPPoE Credentials**  
   - Log into Bell account portal → Internet services → Find "PPPoE Username" (format `b1*******`)  
   - Reset password if unknown through portal controls[5][11]

2. **Configure Bell Home Hub**  
   ```bash
   # Access router at 192.168.100.254
   1. Navigate to Advanced Settings → DMZ/PPPoE
   2. Enable PPPoE Passthrough mode
   3. Disable Bell DHCP server
   4. Disable WiFi radios (optional)
   ```

3. **Reconfigure OPNsense**  
   ```bash
   # WAN Interface Configuration
   1. Set WAN interface type to PPPoE
   2. Input Bell credentials: 
      - Username: b1******* 
      - Password: [your_reset_password]
   3. Set MTU to 1492[2][9]
   4. Enable "Prevent interface removal" in Advanced Settings

   # LAN Interface
   Keep existing 198.18.1.1/24 configuration

   # Firewall Rules
   1. Add allow rule on WAN interface:
      - Protocol: IPv4
      - Source: 192.168.100.0/24
      - Destination: 198.18.1.0/24
   2. Enable NAT reflection[8]
   ```

4. **Physical Reconfiguration**  
   ```bash
   Bell ONT → Home Hub LAN1 → OPNsense WAN
   ```

### Alternative Configurations
**Option 1: Advanced DMZ (Single Public IP)**  
- Assign OPNsense WAN interface (192.168.100.137) as DMZ host[3]  
- Requires manual routing fixes due to Bell's DHCP quirks[2]  
- Not recommended for production environments  

**Option 2: Full Bypass (Advanced)**  
1. Acquire compatible SFP module (e.g., WAS-110)  
2. Configure VLANs:  
   ```bash
   # OPNsense WAN Interface
   - VLAN35 for internet (PPPoE)
   - VLAN36 for TV services (if applicable)[6][9]
   ```
3. Direct fiber connection:  
   ```bash
   Bell ONT SFP → OPNsense SFP+ port
   ```

### Traffic Flow Fixes
**Current Issue Analysis**  
- TTL exceeded errors indicate routing loops through Bell's external gateways  
- Bell router lacks return path to 198.18.1.0/24 network  

**Required Adjustments**  
1. **Eliminate Double NAT**  
   PPPoE passthrough gives OPNsense direct public IP, removing Bell router from data path[5][10]

2. **Asymmetric Routing Prevention**  
   Ensure OPNsense has route for 192.168.100.0/24 via Hyper-V host interface  

---

### Security Considerations
1. **Bell Home Hub Vulnerabilities**  
   Default firmware has:  
   - No configurable SPI firewall rules  
   - Limited port forwarding controls[4]  

2. **Recommended Hardening**  
   ```bash
   # On OPNsense
   1. Enable Suricata IDS/IPS
   2. Implement VLAN segregation
   3. Use WireGuard VPN for lab access
   ```

---

### Performance Validation
After reconfiguration:  
```bash
# From macOS device
ping 198.18.1.1        # Should show <1ms latency
traceroute 198.18.1.50 # Should show single hop through 192.168.100.137

# Speed Validation
iperf3 -c 198.18.1.100 # Expect full LAN throughput
```

This configuration maintains Bell TV services (if used) while enabling full inter-subnet routing. For persistent issues, consider using a L2 managed switch between ONT and routers for VLAN tagging support[6][9].
