To address the user's questions and provide a clear configuration guide for OPNsense 25.1, follow these steps:

## 1. Correct Path to Add an IP Alias
To add an IP alias to a network interface in OPNsense, you should navigate to **Interfaces > LAN > Additional IPv4 addresses**. This is where you can add additional IP addresses to the LAN interface, allowing access from other devices on the network.

## 2. Difference Between "Firewall Aliases" and "Interface IP Aliases"
- **Firewall Aliases**: These are used to group IP addresses, networks, ports, or hostnames for easier management in firewall rules. They help simplify and reduce the number of firewall rules needed by allowing multiple items to be referenced by a single alias name[1][2].
- **Interface IP Aliases**: These are additional IP addresses assigned directly to network interfaces, enabling the device to be accessed via multiple IP addresses on the same interface.

## 3. Configuring Access and Avoiding VPN Conflicts

### Step-by-Step Configuration

#### To Allow Host (192.168.100.x) to Access Lab VMs (198.18.1.x):

1. **Add IP Alias to WAN Interface**:
   - Navigate to **Interfaces > WAN > Additional IPv4 addresses**.
   - Add `192.168.100.200` as an additional IP address to the WAN interface.

2. **Configure Firewall Rules**:
   - Go to **Firewall > Rules > WAN**.
   - Create a new rule allowing traffic from `192.168.100.0/24` to `198.18.1.0/24`.
   - Ensure the protocol is set to allow all necessary traffic (e.g., TCP, UDP).

3. **NAT Rule (if necessary)**:
   - If the traffic needs to be translated, go to **Firewall > NAT > Outbound**.
   - Create a rule to translate traffic from `192.168.100.0/24` to `198.18.1.0/24`.

#### To Allow Corporate Laptop on VPN to Access Lab VMs Without VPN Conflicts:

1. **Avoid VPN Routing Conflicts**:
   - Ensure the VPN client does not route traffic for the lab network (`198.18.1.0/24`) through the VPN tunnel. This might involve configuring split tunneling on the VPN client if possible.

2. **Firewall Rules for VPN Access**:
   - If the VPN client is configured to allow local network access, ensure there are no firewall rules blocking traffic from the VPN client to the lab VMs.

3. **Network Segmentation**:
   - Consider using VLANs to segregate the lab network from the rest of the home network to prevent conflicts and improve security.

### Example Configuration Summary

| **Component** | **Configuration** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| WAN Interface | Add `192.168.100.200` as an additional IP |
| Firewall Rules | Allow traffic from `192.168.100.0/24` to `198.18.1.0/24` |
| NAT Rules | Translate traffic if necessary |
| VPN Client | Configure split tunneling to avoid routing conflicts |

By following these steps, you should be able to configure OPNsense to allow access from the host machine and avoid conflicts with the corporate VPN.
