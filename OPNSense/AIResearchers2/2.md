# Understanding and Configuring IP Aliases in OPNsense 25.1

OPNsense 25.1, released in January 2025 and nicknamed "Ultimate Unicorn," offers several methods for managing additional IP addresses on interfaces. This report will clarify the differences between various types of aliases in OPNsense and provide precise guidance for your home lab setup to avoid VPN conflicts.

## Firewall Aliases vs. Interface IP Aliases

There is a fundamental difference between these two concepts that is causing confusion:

### Firewall Aliases

Firewall aliases are named collections of networks, hosts, or ports that can be referenced in firewall rules[1]. They help simplify rule management by allowing you to group related items under a single name. However, they do not add additional IP addresses to any interface.

Firewall aliases are located at:
```
Firewall > Aliases
```

These aliases are particularly useful for condensing firewall rules and minimizing changes when managing groups of addresses[1]. While powerful for rule management, this is not what you need for adding an additional IP to your interface.

### Interface IP Aliases (Virtual IPs)

To add an additional IP address to a network interface (what you're trying to accomplish), you need to configure what OPNsense calls a "Virtual IP"[4]. This is the correct functionality for adding 192.168.100.200 as an additional address to access your OPNsense router.

## Correct Configuration Path

In OPNsense 25.1, to add an additional IP address to your WAN interface, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Firewall > Virtual IPs**
2. Click **+ Add** in the top right
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Mode**: Select "IP Alias"
   - **Interface**: Select your WAN interface (hn0)
   - **Type**: Single address
   - **Address**: Enter 192.168.100.200
   - **Subnet mask**: 32 (for a single IP) or 24 (to match your network)
   - **Description**: Add a meaningful description (e.g., "Host Access IP")
4. Click **Save**
5. Apply changes when prompted

This creates a virtual IP address on your WAN interface, effectively giving you an additional address on that interface[4].

## Network Configuration for Lab Access

To enable proper access between your host machine and lab VMs while avoiding corporate VPN conflicts, you'll need to configure:

### 1. Firewall Rules for Access

After adding the virtual IP, you'll need to create firewall rules to allow traffic between your host (192.168.100.x) and the lab network (198.18.1.x):

1. Navigate to **Firewall > Rules > WAN**
2. Click **+ Add** to create a new rule
3. Configure:
   - **Action**: Pass
   - **Interface**: WAN
   - **Direction**: in
   - **TCP/IP Version**: IPv4
   - **Protocol**: Any (or limit to specific protocols if desired)
   - **Source**: Single host or network (192.168.100.0/24 or your specific host IP)
   - **Destination**: Network (198.18.1.0/24)
4. Click **Save** and apply changes

### 2. NAT Configuration

To ensure proper routing between networks:

1. Navigate to **Firewall > NAT > Outbound**
2. Set mode to "Hybrid outbound NAT" or "Manual outbound NAT"
3. Add a rule for your lab network to use the WAN interface when accessing external resources
4. This allows your lab VMs to access the internet while keeping their internal addressing

### 3. Avoiding Corporate VPN Conflicts

To prevent conflicts with your corporate VPN:

1. Use a non-standard private IP range for your lab network (which you've done with 198.18.1.0/24)[3]
2. Configure firewall rules to isolate corporate VPN traffic from lab traffic
3. Consider setting up policy-based or route-based VPN access for specific resources[12][15]

## Advanced Configuration

For more complex setups where you need to route specific traffic through different gateways:

1. You can use virtual IPs to create multiple access points to your OPNsense router[4][9]
2. Configure aliases for groups of services or IPs that need specific routing rules[6]
3. Use policy-based routing if you need to route traffic differently based on source/destination[12]

When your corporate laptop connects to the VPN, traffic will be routed according to the corporate VPN policies. By keeping your lab network on a non-overlapping subnet (198.18.1.0/24), you reduce the chance of routing conflicts[8].

## Conclusion

The confusion stemmed from looking at "Firewall Aliases" instead of "Virtual IPs" for interface address configuration. By properly configuring a virtual IP alias on your WAN interface, you'll be able to access your OPNsense router and lab VMs from your host machine without interfering with corporate VPN connectivity.

If you need further assistance with specific routing scenarios between your corporate laptop and lab environment, additional firewall rule configurations may be necessary to ensure smooth traffic flow without VPN disruptions.
