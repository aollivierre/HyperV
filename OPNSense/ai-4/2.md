# OPNsense Home Lab VPN Solution Comparison and Implementation Guide

## Accuracy Check and Assumptions

Before providing recommendations, I need to clarify several elements of your setup:

- Your OPNsense WAN IP is noted as 192.168.100.x, but the exact IP is unspecified
- I'm assuming your Bell home router allows port forwarding capabilities
- It's unclear whether you have a static or dynamic public IP from Bell
- The specific OPNsense version isn't mentioned (though implementation steps are valid for recent versions)
- Your primary requirement of "doesn't require installing software on corporate laptop" significantly narrows viable options

### Verification and Testing

#### Connection Testing

1. From a non-corporate device first, connect to your OpenVPN server
2. Verify you can ping devices on the 198.18.1.x network
3. Check routing table to ensure traffic to 198.18.1.0/24 is routed through VPN
4. Test access to specific services on your lab VMs

#### Security Validation

1. Verify encryption is working by capturing traffic on WAN and confirming it's encrypted
2. Test for DNS leaks using a service like dnsleaktest.com[20]
3. Check OpenVPN logs for authentication successes and failures
4. Verify TLS handshake is completing successfully

#### Corporate Laptop Access Method

1. Access https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/connecting-to-access-server-with-connect-client/
2. Click "Connect to Web Portal"
3. Import the .ovpn configuration file generated from the Client Export package
4. Connect without installing desktop software

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Connection Timeouts:**
   - Verify port forwarding is working
   - Check Bell router isn't blocking VPN traffic
   - Try different ports if 443 is blocked

2. **Authentication Failures:**
   - Check user credentials
   - Verify certificate validity
   - Check log files for specific error messages

3. **Routing Issues:**
   - Verify firewall rules are allowing traffic
   - Check route tables on client and server
   - Ensure no IP conflicts between networks

4. **Performance Issues:**
   - Consider UDP instead of TCP if compatible with network restrictions
   - Adjust MTU settings if fragmentation occurs
   - Monitor CPU usage on OPNsense during connections

## Performance Expectations

- **Latency:** Adds approximately 5-15ms overhead to direct connections
- **Throughput:** Expect 50-70% of your available bandwidth when using OpenVPN over TCP[19]
- **Connection time:** Initial connection may take 5-10 seconds to establish

By implementing OpenVPN this way, you'll have a solution that works from restrictive networks, doesn't require software installation on your corporate laptop, and provides secure access to your entire lab network.
