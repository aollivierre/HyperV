## Accuracy Check and Assumptions

Your setup appears well-defined, but a few points require clarification or assumptions:

1. **OPNsense Version**: The version of OPNsense you are using is not specified. This could affect the availability of certain features or plugins.
2. **Bell Router Configuration**: It is assumed that you have access to configure port forwarding on your Bell router if necessary.
3. **DNS Setup**: It is unclear if you have a DNS server set up for hostname resolution within your lab network.

## Comparative Analysis

### VPN Solutions

Here's a comparison of **Headscale**, **WireGuard**, **Netmaker**, and **ZeroTier** based on your requirements:

| **Solution** | **Performance** | **Ease of Setup** | **Security Features** | **Advantages/Disadvantages** |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Headscale** | Good, but dependent on Tailscale's architecture | Moderate, requires some setup | Secure, uses Tailscale's protocol | Advantages: Zero-config, secure. Disadvantages: Not fully self-hosted in the traditional sense, requires a controller. |
| **WireGuard** | High, fast and efficient | Easy, especially with OPNsense integration | Strong cryptographic primitives, secure | Advantages: Fast, secure, easy to set up. Disadvantages: Requires client software on devices. |
| **Netmaker** | Good, designed for mesh networks | Easy, with a focus on simplicity | Secure, uses WireGuard under the hood | Advantages: Easy to manage, supports mesh networks. Disadvantages: Less control over underlying WireGuard settings. |
| **ZeroTier** | Good, designed for virtual networks | Easy, with a simple setup process | Secure, supports multiple protocols | Advantages: Easy to set up, supports multiple protocols. Disadvantages: Requires a controller, less control over security settings. |

### Recommendation

**WireGuard** is recommended for your use case due to its ease of setup, high performance, and strong security features. It integrates well with OPNsense and can be configured as a subnet router for your lab network.

## Implementation Guide: WireGuard on OPNsense

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Install WireGuard Plugin on OPNsense**:
   - Navigate to **System** → **Firmware** → **Plugins**.
   - Search for `os-wireguard`. However, as of OPNsense 24.1, WireGuard is included in the core system, so this step may not be necessary[4].
   - Refresh the browser page to access WireGuard configuration via **VPN** → **WireGuard**.

2. **Configure WireGuard VPN Server**:
   - Go to **VPN** → **WireGuard** → **General** and enable WireGuard.
   - Navigate to the **Local** tab and click **+** to add a new configuration.
   - Set **Name** (e.g., `LabWireGuard`), **Listen Port** (e.g., 51820), and **Tunnel Address** (e.g., `10.0.0.1/24`).
   - Save the configuration to generate key pairs[4].

3. **Configure WireGuard Client**:
   - Generate a key pair for the client.
   - Configure the client with the server's public key and the client's private key.
   - Set the client's IP address within the tunnel network (e.g., `10.0.0.2/32`)[3].

4. **Configure as Subnet Router**:
   - Ensure that the WireGuard tunnel allows traffic between the `10.0.0.x` network and your `198.18.1.x` network.
   - Set up firewall rules in OPNsense to allow traffic between these networks.

5. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Connect to the WireGuard VPN from a remote location.
   - Verify that you can access devices on the `198.18.1.x` network.

### Security Considerations and Best Practices

- **Use Strong Cryptographic Keys**: Ensure that all devices have unique, securely generated key pairs.
- **Limit Access**: Only allow necessary devices to connect to the VPN.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Ensure that OPNsense's firewall rules are set to allow traffic between the VPN tunnel and your lab network.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep OPNsense and WireGuard up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.

### Typical Latency/Performance Expectations

WireGuard is known for its low latency and high throughput, making it suitable for most remote access needs.

### Additional Configurations

- **Port Forwarding**: You may need to configure port forwarding on your Bell router to allow incoming VPN connections.
- **DNS Setup**: If you plan to use hostnames for your lab devices, consider setting up a DNS server for hostname resolution.

## Verification Steps

1. **Connectivity Test**: Attempt to connect to devices on your `198.18.1.x` network from a remote location via the VPN.
2. **Security Audit**: Review OPNsense logs and firewall rules to ensure that only authorized traffic is passing through the VPN.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor latency and throughput to ensure they meet your requirements.

This setup should provide a secure and efficient way to access your home lab network remotely.
