# OPNsense Home Lab VPN Solution Analysis

## Accuracy Check

Before proceeding with recommendations, I should clarify a few assumptions about your setup:

- Your OPNsense firewall has a specific WAN IP (192.168.100.x) that isn't specified, but I assume it has proper internet connectivity
- Your Bell home router allows for some degree of port forwarding (mentioned in search results with mixed experiences)[10]
- By "doesn't require installing software on corporate laptop," you likely mean minimal client footprint or browser-based solutions, as all VPN solutions require some form of client software

## Comparative Analysis of VPN Solutions

### WireGuard on OPNsense

**Performance:** Consistently achieves the highest throughput in speed tests, with data transfer rates averaging 7.88 Gbits/sec in high-performance networks[9]. Very efficient with low overhead.

**Setup Complexity:** Moderately simple with native OPNsense support. Configuration requires generating keys and setting up tunnel instances and peers[4].

**Security:** Uses modern cryptographic principles with a smaller, auditable codebase (approximately 4,000 lines of code) and current encryption standards[3].

**Advantages for your case:**
- Native integration with OPNsense[4]
- Excellent performance for remote access[9]
- Works well with subnet routing configurations
- Can use non-standard ports to bypass restrictive networks

**Disadvantages for your case:**
- May cause significant CPU load increases when running virtualized. One user reported 13.5x higher CPU utilization when moving from bare metal to virtualized environments[8]
- Requires client software installation
- Limited options for web-based access

### OpenVPN on OPNsense

**Performance:** Slower than WireGuard, typically achieving 650-700 Mbit/s compared to WireGuard's ~880 Mbit/s in similar environments[8].

**Setup Complexity:** More complex configuration with certificates, but OPNsense offers a comprehensive GUI and wizard[13][14].

**Security:** Mature, well-tested protocol with strong security track record. Supports various authentication methods including certificates, passwords, and 2FA[13].

**Advantages for your case:**
- Works reliably over TCP port 443, ideal for bypassing corporate firewalls[13]
- More mature with extensive documentation and troubleshooting resources
- Supports multiple authentication methods including client certificates + password + OTP[13]
- Can be configured as a road warrior setup specifically designed for remote users[13]

**Disadvantages for your case:**
- More complex configuration than WireGuard
- Lower performance compared to WireGuard-based solutions
- Higher resource usage than WireGuard

### Netmaker (WireGuard-based)

**Performance:** Nearly identical performance to kernel WireGuard (7.88 Gbits/sec vs 7.89 Gbits/sec), significantly outperforming other VPN solutions[9].

**Setup Complexity:** Requires setup on a separate VM using Docker, making the overall architecture more complex than a direct OPNsense implementation.

**Security:** Uses WireGuard protocol for encryption with additional access control features, promoting a zero-trust security model[7].

**Advantages for your case:**
- High performance (WireGuard-based)[9]
- Excellent network management capabilities for complex lab environments
- Robust mesh networking capabilities
- Better suited for scaling to multiple networks if your lab grows[3]

**Disadvantages for your case:**
- Requires separate VM setup rather than direct OPNsense integration
- More complex management architecture
- Requires client software installation

## Implementation Guide: WireGuard on OPNsense

Despite the potential CPU concern with virtualized environments[8], I recommend WireGuard on OPNsense as your primary solution due to its superior performance, simpler configuration, and direct integration with your existing OPNsense firewall. The CPU issue may or may not affect your specific setup, and can be monitored after implementation.

### Step 1: Install WireGuard Plugin (if needed)

1. Navigate to `System → Firmware → Plugins`
2. Search for `os-wireguard` 
3. Click the `+` icon to install
4. Refresh your browser

Note: If you're using OPNsense 24.1+, WireGuard is already included in the core system[4].

### Step 2: Configure WireGuard Server

1. Navigate to `VPN → WireGuard → General` and check the box to enable WireGuard[4]
2. Go to the `Local` tab and click `+` to add a new configuration[4]
3. Configure with these settings:
   - Enable: Checked
   - Name: "HomeLabVPN" (or your preference)
   - Listen port: 51820 (can be changed if needed)
   - Tunnel Address: "198.18.1.254/24" (choosing an unused IP in your lab subnet)
   - DNS Server: "198.18.1.1" (your OPNsense LAN IP)
4. Click `Save`, which will generate public and private key pairs automatically[4]

### Step 3: Create WireGuard Interface Assignment

1. Navigate to `Interfaces → Assignments`
2. Add the WireGuard interface and name it (e.g., "WG")
3. Click on the newly added interface, check "Enable Interface" and save[6]

### Step 4: Configure WireGuard Client Peer

1. Go to `VPN → WireGuard → Peers` and click `+`
2. Configure with:
   - Enable: Checked
   - Name: "RemoteClient" (or your preference)
   - Public Key: (leave blank for now)
   - Allowed IPs: "10.10.0.2/32" (a separate IP for the client)
   - Endpoint address: (leave blank)
   - Keepalive: 25 seconds
3. Save the configuration[6]

### Step 5: Generate Client Configuration

1. Install WireGuard client on a test device (not your corporate laptop yet)
2. Generate a key pair in the client
3. Copy the client's public key to the OPNsense peer configuration
4. Configure client with:
   - Server public key: (from OPNsense)
   - Server endpoint: your.public.ip:51820 or dynamic DNS address
   - Allowed IPs: 198.18.1.0/24 (your lab network)
   - Client IP: 10.10.0.2/32 (matching the peer configuration)

### Step 6: Configure Firewall Rules

1. Navigate to `Firewall → Rules → WAN`
2. Add a rule to allow WireGuard traffic:
   - Action: Pass
   - Interface: WAN
   - Protocol: UDP
   - Source: Any
   - Destination: WAN address
   - Destination port: 51820 (your WireGuard port)
   - Description: "Allow WireGuard"[12]

3. Navigate to `Firewall → Rules → WG` (your WireGuard interface)
4. Add a rule to allow traffic from VPN to LAN:
   - Action: Pass
   - Interface: WG
   - Protocol: Any
   - Source: Any
   - Destination: Any
   - Description: "Allow VPN to LAN"[12]

### Step 7: Configure NAT for Subnet Routing

1. Navigate to `Firewall → NAT → Outbound`
2. Select "Manual outbound NAT rule generation"
3. Add a rule:
   - Interface: WAN
   - Source: 10.10.0.0/24 (WireGuard client network)
   - Destination: Any
   - Translation: Interface address
4. Save and apply changes[6]

### Step 8: Bell Router Port Forwarding

1. Log into your Bell router administration panel
2. Navigate to port forwarding settings
3. Create a new port forwarding rule:
   - Protocol: UDP
   - External port: 51820
   - Internal IP: 192.168.100.x (your OPNsense WAN IP)
   - Internal port: 51820

Note: If your Bell router doesn't support port forwarding, consider alternative methods like using Tailscale alongside WireGuard to establish the initial connection[10].

## Verification Steps

1. **Basic Connectivity Test**:
   - From a client device, attempt to connect using the WireGuard client
   - Verify connection status in the client
   - Check `VPN → WireGuard → Status` in OPNsense for active connections

2. **Subnet Routing Test**:
   - From the connected client, ping your OPNsense LAN IP (198.18.1.1)
   - Ping another device on your lab network (e.g., 198.18.1.10)
   - Try accessing services on your lab VMs by IP address

3. **Security Verification**:
   - Use `tcpdump` on OPNsense to verify encrypted traffic
   - Verify firewall rules are working by temporarily disabling and re-enabling them
   - Test connection from different networks (home, mobile hotspot)

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure latency with ping commands
   - Test file transfer speeds to determine throughput
   - Monitor CPU usage on OPNsense during active VPN usage to check for the potential virtualization issue[8]

## Alternative Approach for Corporate Laptop

Since installing client software on your corporate laptop may be restricted, consider this alternative approach:

1. Set up an SSL VPN (OpenVPN) on TCP port 443 alongside WireGuard
2. Configure OpenVPN with a web portal for browser-based access
3. This provides a fallback method when client software installation isn't possible

This dual approach gives you WireGuard's performance for regular use while providing alternative access methods from restricted environments.
